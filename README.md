# MQTT-Home-Automation-Hub
##Introduction
The SmartRule Hub is an open source rule engine designed run on linux devices such as the Raspberry Pi. This hub will allow you to easily create rules to manage and communicate between your smart home devices. 

The aim of this project is to to increase adoption of home automation by reducing costs, increasing usability and providing brand interoperability. I have used low cost hardware to produce the SmartRule Hub and Smart devices. I have produced an easy to interface that can be accesses through the browser on any device. I have used MQTT to communicate between the hub and devices which is open standard of machine to machine communication.
